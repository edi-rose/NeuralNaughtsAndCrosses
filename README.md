Hello and welcome to my Naughts and Crosses Neural Network (WIP)

I am using the naughts and crosses bot from a previous project to
train a neural network to play the great game. I will be using the brain.js module.

In Bots folder you'll find the code for my bot which I am using to collect the
correct outputs.

In boardStuff folder you'll find how I am randomizing my boards to have as inputs.

The helpers folder helps me turn all that into a format brain.js can tolerate
with the final creation of data being done in the 'assembleData' file.
